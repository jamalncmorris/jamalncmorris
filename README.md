# Jamal N.C Morris

Python and JavaScript Developer | Full-Stack Software Engineer | Technology Enthusiast 

I specialize in developing modern, browser-based software solutions using Django/DRF for backend development and React + Tailwind for frontend interfaces. This stack (py:Backend + js:Frontend) enables me to create robust, scalable web applications. My technical journey began with Python scripting and automation for data analytics, which sparked my passion for programming. 

In addition to software development, I have a strong background in manufacturing, with expertise in CNC 3+2 axis milling programming, 3D modeling, and 2D technical engineering drawing. My early career in CAD/CAM provided a solid foundation for my technical and problem-solving skills.
